# ðŸ’¬ e-commerce chatbot (Gen AI RAG project using LLama3.3 and GROQ)

This is POC of an intelligent chatbot tailored for an e-commerce platform, enabling seamless user interactions by accurately identifying the intent behind user queries. It leverages real-time access to the platform's database, allowing it to provide precise and up-to-date responses.

Folder structure
1. app: All the code for chatbot
2. web-scraping: Code to scrap e-commerce website 

This chatbot currently supports two intents:

- **faq**: Triggered when users ask questions related to the platform's policies or general information. eg. Is online payment available?
- **sql**: Activated when users request product listings or information based on real-time database queries. eg. Show me all nike shoes below Rs. 3000.
